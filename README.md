he project aims at stabilizing a 2-wheel Robot. The robot should be stable against minor external disturbances and should be able to maintain its balance. In this project, we have designed a model of the self-balancing robot using the PID(Proportional, Integral, Derivative) Algorithm. The self-balancing robot is essentially an inverted pendulum
